I decided to develop this memory game because I felt it would provide a difficult enough challenge where I would learn as much as I could in a short one week timeframe.  I wanted to really push my knowledge of iterating through data structures and manipulating the DOM, so I decided I would render the HTML elements using JS rather than building them in my HTML file first.  This taught me valuable lessens about understanding the importance of scope when it comes to variables and functions in my projects.  Overall, this project was a great deal of fun to develop and I tried to be as creative with the CSS, backgrounds, and browser audio as I could.

* Start off with 8 lives and try to get all 8 card matches.
* The "Lives Left" counter will decrease by one everytime the player flips two cards and doesn't get a match.
* The "Matches" counter will show the player how many matches they have, get all 8 to win the game.
* If the player runs out of lives, the game will automatically reset the cards to the facedown position.
* Notice that the cards stay face up until you reset the game when you win, I wanted to showcase the beautiful artwork for each of the cards.
* Pressing the "Play Again" button will reset the Lives/Matches counters, the position of the cards and reshuffle the cards on the table, so they are not in the same location as the last game.
