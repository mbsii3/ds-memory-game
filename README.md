I decided to develop this memory game because I felt it would provide a difficult enough challenge where I would learn as much as I could in a short one week timeframe.  I wanted to really push my knowledge of what I had learned in Unit One, so I decided I would render the HTML elements using JS rather than building them in my HTML file first.  This taught me valuable lessens about understanding the importance of scope when it comes to variables and functions in my projects.  Overall, this project was a great deal of fun to develop and I tried to be as creative with the CSS, backgrounds, and browser audio as I could.

* Start off with 8 lives and try to get all 8 card matches.
* If you run out of lives before you acheive all 8 card matches, the above header notifies you that you have lost.
* Notice that the cards stay face up until you reset the game when you win, I wanted to showcase the beautiful artwork for each of the cards.
